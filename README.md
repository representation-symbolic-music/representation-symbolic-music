### This is repository of paper "Short-time continuous representation learning of symbolic music"
There are some experiment samples in the "samples" directory.  All samples are picked randomly.   
We provide two kinds of format of files. The first one is midi format, which can be opened through "https://cifkao.github.io/html-midi-player/", one online midi player. 
The second one is audio format, which are rendered from midi.    
1) "samples/reconstruction_midi": the midi files of original midi and reconstructed midi
2) "samples/reconstruction_mp3": the audio files of original audio and reconstructed audio
3) "samples/rearrangement_midi": the midi files of original midi and rearranged midi
4) "samples/rearrangement_mp3": the audio files of original audio and rearranged audio        
(In each directory, '_ori' means the original audio or midi, and '_gen' means the reconstructed or rearranged ones)
